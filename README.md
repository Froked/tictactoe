tictactoe
=========

A LINQy TicTacToe implementation in C# for [this question on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/q/16550022/458193).  
Its model is separated from presentation so the OP can write real GUI on top of it.

Because most of `TicTacToe` code is functional, it would be a fun excercize to make `TicTacToe` class immutable, so each `MakeMove` “forks” it. I'm sure there are plenty tutorials that do this already.
